Researchers have tested dogs' ability to perceive information, retain it as knowledge, and apply it to solve problems.
Studies of two dogs suggest that dogs can learn by inference and have advanced memory skills. A study with Rico, a Border Collie,
showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items. He inferred the names of novel things by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those new items immediately and four weeks after the initial exposure. A study of another Border Collie, Chaser, documented his learning and memory capabilities. He had learned the names and could associate by verbal command over 1,000 words.
Dogs can read and react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing, pointing, and human voice commands.
