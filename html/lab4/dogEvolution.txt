The earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a domesticated dog were discovered in
               Bonn-Oberkassel, Germany. Contextual, isotopic, genetic, and morphological evidence shows that this dog
               was
               not a local wolf. The dog was dated to 14,223 years ago and was found buried along with a man and a
               woman, all three having been sprayed with red hematite powder and buried under large, thick basalt
               blocks.
               The dog had died of canine distemper. Earlier remains dating back to 30,000 years ago have been
               described as Paleolithic dogs, but their status as dogs or wolves remains debated because considerable
               morphological diversity existed among wolves during the Late Pleistocene.

               The dog is a classic example of a domestic animal that likely travelled a commensal pathway into
               domestication. The questions of when and where dogs were first domesticated have taxed geneticists
               and archaeologists for decades. Genetic studies suggest a domestication process commencing over 25,000
               years ago, in one or several wolf populations in either Europe, the high Arctic, or eastern Asia. In
               2021, a literature review of the current evidence infers that the dog was domesticated in Siberia 23,000
               years ago by ancient North Siberians, then later dispersed eastward into the Americas and westward across
               Eurasia, with dogs likely accompanying the first humans to inhabit the Americas.
