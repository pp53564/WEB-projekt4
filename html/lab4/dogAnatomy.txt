All healthy dogs, regardless of their size and type, have an identical skeletal structure with the
               exception of the number of bones in the tail, although there is significant skeletal variation between
               dogs of different types. The dog's skeleton is well adapted for running; the vertebrae on the
               neck and back have extensions for powerful back muscles to connect to, the long ribs provide plenty of
               room for the heart and lungs, and the shoulders are unattached to the skeleton allowing great
               flexibility.

               Compared to the dog's wolf-like ancestors, selective breeding since domestication has seen the dog's
               skeleton greatly enhanced in size for larger types as mastiffs and miniaturised for smaller types such as
               terriers; dwarfism has been selectively utilised for some types where short legs are advantageous such as
               dachshunds and corgis. Most dogs naturally have 26 vertebrae in their tails, but some with naturally
               short tails have as few as three.

               The dog's skull has identical components regardless of breed type, but there is significant divergence in
               terms of skull shape between types. The three basic skull shapes are the elongated
               dolichocephalic type as seen in sighthounds, the intermediate mesocephalic or mesaticephalic type, and
               the very short and broad brachycephalic type exemplified by mastiff type skulls.
