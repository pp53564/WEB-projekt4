Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of 
the domestic dog (individuals or groups) to internal and external stimuli.
 As the oldest domesticated species, dogs' minds inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans.
As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs have acquired the ability to understand and communicate withÄ‡humans more than any other species and they are uniquely attuned to human behaviors.
Behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in domestic dogs.
These abilities are not possessed by the dog's closest canine relatives or other highly intelligent mammals, 
such as great apes, but rather parallel to children's social-cognitive skills.
