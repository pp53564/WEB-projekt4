The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also
               called the domestic dog, it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves, and the modern wolf is the
               dog's nearest living relative. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans.
               Hunter-gatherers did this, over 15,000 years ago in Germany, which was before the development of
               agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic
               individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other
               canids.
